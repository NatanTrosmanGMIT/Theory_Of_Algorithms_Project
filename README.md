# Polynomial Time 
This Jupyter notebook provides an introduction to the concept of polynomial time complexity in computer science. It covers the basics of algorithmic time complexity, including big O notation and the difference between polynomial and exponential time complexity.

The notebook also includes examples of problems that can be solved in polynomial time, such as sorting and searching algorithms, and explains the significance of polynomial time algorithms in industry and research.

Additionally, the notebook explores the P vs. NP problem, one of the most famous open problems in computer science, and its implications for the possibility of efficient algorithms for certain types of problems.

The notebook is written in Python and includes code examples demonstrating polynomial time algorithms.
